# Module specifications

These documents describe the implemented module boundaries. They are maintenance contracts: each document states ownership, durable invariants, external interfaces, failure behavior, and the verification expected before release.

| Module | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime, persistence, scheduler, and backups | [platform-runtime.md](platform-runtime.md) |
| Telegram identity and onboarding | [accounts-onboarding.md](accounts-onboarding.md) |
| Catalog, purchases, access terms, and rollover projection | [catalog-entitlements.md](catalog-entitlements.md) |
| Typed internal squad profiles | [squad-profiles.md](squad-profiles.md) |
| TXB ledger, top-ups, and refunds | [billing-payments.md](billing-payments.md) |
| Games, daily check-ins, group-message rewards, and lucky draws | [activity.md](activity.md) |
| Coupon definitions, wallet grants, and purchase discounts | [coupons.md](coupons.md) |
| Questionnaire participation and CSV settlement | [questionnaires.md](questionnaires.md) |
| Emby account setup and restricted policy management | [emby.md](emby.md) |
| Telegram, Remnawave, EZPay, and BEPusdt adapters | [integrations.md](integrations.md) |
| Admin authorization and domain operations | [admin-operations.md](admin-operations.md) |
| Vue Mini App and generated API client | [web-ui.md](web-ui.md) |
| TX Carpool bug-fix adjustment contract | [tx-carpool-adjustments.md](tx-carpool-adjustments.md) |

## TX Carpool adjustment specification

The current mobile-first adjustment set is covered by the existing module
contracts: `web-ui.md` owns responsive catalog, renewal, traffic, admin, and
payment surfaces; `billing-payments.md` owns stable-ID provider-account profiles;
`admin-operations.md` owns stock, balance, coupon, backup, and database-editor
administration; and `integrations.md` owns shared provider credentials and
callback capabilities. No Remnawave or Emby request bypasses the upstream queue
boundary described in the integration specification.

The split HTTP contract is indexed from [api/README.md](../../api/README.md), and the frontend file maps start at [web/README.md](../../web/README.md) and [web/src/README.md](../../web/src/README.md).

Cross-module rules:

- HTTP request/response compatibility is defined by `api/openapi.yaml`; generated frontend types must not be hand-edited.
- All blocking repository and provider calls accept `context.Context`. Background work stops through the application context.
- SQLite is the source of truth for identity, money, purchases, callback deduplication, and pending work. Provider redirects and browser events are never authoritative.
- IDs are opaque strings, timestamps are RFC3339 UTC strings, TXB uses integer hundredths, provider decimals use fixed-decimal parsing, and traffic byte counts never pass through floating point.
- Secret and bearer values are redacted at the logging boundary. Sensitive dashboard settings are AES-256-GCM encrypted and write-only through the API.
- Domain APIs treat ledger entries, refunds, webhook receipts, Activity results, questionnaire awards, rollover results, and audit events as immutable; corrections use compensating records. The explicitly warned break-glass database editor can bypass domain hooks only after diff review, typed confirmation, rescue backup, and audit.
- Production frontend and backend code is limited to 200 physical lines per file; tests, generated clients, migrations, API documents, and embedded build output are exempt. Every split implementation file is indexed by its package README.
- Telegram WebApp lifecycle is initialized before Vue Router construction, waits for delayed WebApp context, synchronizes safe areas and theme colors, and gives the most recent visible overlay ownership of native BackButton navigation.

# Platform and runtime module

## Ownership

The platform layer owns bootstrap configuration, structured logging, IDs, AES-256-GCM setting encryption, SQLite lifecycle and migrations, HTTP lifecycle, embedded Vue assets, the durable outbox scheduler, and online backups. `cmd/server` only parses `serve` or `healthcheck`, loads configuration, builds the application, and manages process cancellation.

Bootstrap environment is intentionally narrow: `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and `CONFIG_MASTER_KEY` are required; `PORT`, `DATA_DIR`, `TZ`, and `LOG_LEVEL` have documented defaults. Provider credentials and business configuration belong in the encrypted settings registry rather than process environment.

## Persistence contract

- The authoritative database lives on disk at `${DATA_DIR}/tx-carpool.db`; backups live below `${DATA_DIR}/backups`. It is never mirrored wholesale into memory.
- Every connection enables foreign keys, WAL, a busy timeout, a 16 MiB page cache, a 128 MiB mmap ceiling, memory-backed temporary storage, and `synchronous=FULL`. The pool is fixed at four connections; passive checkpoints run normally and a final checkpoint runs before backup and shutdown.
- Embedded migrations run in order before HTTP readiness. A migration failure aborts startup without partially advertising readiness.
- Business transactions write durable state and their required outbox job together. The dispatcher routes each claimed job to the handler registered for its exact kind; Remnawave, rollover, Emby, and questionnaire workers can never claim one another's work. Workers use bounded leases/transactions, increment attempts, and preserve the last operator-safe error.
- Typed outbox payloads are the only target-ID source. A partial unique index on canonical `(kind,payload)` deduplicates pending/processing work, and processing jobs cannot be deleted. Audit insertion transactionally retains the newest 200 audit events. The platform never offers raw SQL over HTTP.
- The embedded filesystem contains the Vite production output. Unknown non-API paths fall back to the SPA entry point; API and operational misses return normal HTTP errors and never the SPA.

## Scheduler and backup behavior

One application-owned scheduler starts after migrations and stops when the root context is cancelled. It handles queued entitlement transitions, expired access, retryable Remnawave work, Stars reconciliation, and the daily backup trigger. Work is idempotent so a crash between provider success and job acknowledgement can be replayed safely.

The backup task first checkpoints WAL, uses SQLite's online-safe mechanism, writes a temporary file, verifies that file by opening/checking it, then atomically renames it. The destructive schema migration similarly creates and integrity-checks a pre-migration snapshot before rebuilding tables. Backup deletion is denied while restore is staging/restarting, resolves the stored path beneath the configured backup directory, removes file and metadata consistently, and records an audit event.

A restore accepts only a verified stored snapshot. It creates a rescue backup, checks SQLite integrity and migration compatibility, stages the candidate beside the live database, writes a durable restore marker, returns `202`, and triggers graceful shutdown. On the next startup, the marker is processed before opening the application database: the files are swapped atomically, the replacement is opened and verified, and failure restores the rescue copy. Restore status is recorded for the reconnecting administrator, who must reauthenticate after restart.

## Failure behavior

- `/healthz` returns success when the process can serve HTTP and SQLite responds. It does not depend on external providers.
- `/readyz` returns 503 for database failure or incomplete required dashboard setup and includes non-secret checks.
- Graceful shutdown stops admission, cancels workers, waits within the configured timeout, closes SQLite, and returns wrapped errors.
- A malformed bootstrap value fails fast with its environment variable named, but its secret value omitted.
- Decryption failure marks the setting unusable and setup incomplete; the ciphertext and key are never logged.
- Static asset misses cannot shadow `/api`, `/healthz`, or `/readyz`.

## Verification

- Migration tests cover a fresh database and reopening an existing schema with foreign keys/WAL enabled.
- Secret tests cover random nonces, authentication failure, invalid base64 master keys, masking, and no plaintext response.
- Scheduler tests use a controllable clock and cover cancellation, duplicate ticks, crash/retry, and bounded backoff.
- Backup tests cover atomic completion, authenticated download, rescue creation, marker validation, staged restore success/failure rollback, single-flight behavior, and retention boundaries.
- HTTP tests cover SPA fallback, API 404 behavior, health/readiness transitions, request IDs, secure headers, and graceful cancellation.

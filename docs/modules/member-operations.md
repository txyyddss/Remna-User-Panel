# Member subscription operations

## Ownership and interfaces

`internal/connections` owns asynchronous connection scans, transient IP projections, signed drop capabilities, and selected-IP unlink reconciliation. `internal/purchaseops` owns paid traffic-reset and first-term refund quotes, commands, and workers. HTTP exposes connection scan/poll/drop under `/api/v1/subscription/connections`, reset and refund quote/mutations under `/api/v1/purchases/{id}`, and owner-scoped receipts at `/api/v1/operations/{id}`.

All mutations require `Idempotency-Key`. SQLite stores the request fingerprint, receipt, bounded target metadata, money effects, and outbox job before accepting work. Provider calls run only after the transaction commits and always enter the shared Remnawave queue. The neutral `providerops.Dispatcher` is registered once with the outbox and remains open to member, administrator, and maintenance operation kinds. Receipt reads accept only the authenticated operation actor or affected owner, allowing an administrator to poll a command they issued without exposing it to unrelated users.

## Connection privacy and reconciliation

Connection scan rows retain only owner, provider job ID, progress, status, and expiry. Completed provider IP results are returned directly to the authenticated owner and receive 15-minute HMAC handles binding owner, scan, node, IP, and expiry. Raw IPs and handles are not stored in operation tables. A drop item stores only a target hash; its handle is AES-GCM encrypted in the atomic outbox payload.

A worker records intent before starting a provider scan or drop. A scan-start interruption or provider error with no durable job ID becomes `pending_review` instead of repeating an uncertain POST. An interrupted or ambiguous drop starts a fresh user scan and checks the selected node/IP. Absence succeeds; a confirmed rejection fails; an unresolved result becomes `pending_review` and is never blindly retried.

## Reset and refund invariants

- Reset pricing uses immutable `core_gross_txb_minor`, excluding coupons and add-ons. `DAY` is ceiling division by 30, `WEEK` by 4, and `MONTH_ROLLING` uses the full basis, all in integer TXB minor units.
- Reset debit, ledger entry, operation item, receipt, and outbox job commit atomically. A definitive failure credits that exact debit once and marks the receipt `compensated`. Ambiguous results reconcile through `lastTrafficResetAt` or become `pending_review`.
- Refund eligibility requires the authenticated owner's active first lineage term, a creation age strictly below 24 hours, and live used traffic equal to zero. The worker disables upstream access first, rereads usage, and restores the original exact entitlement on nonzero usage or a local state conflict.
- Successful refund cancellation, immutable original net-debit credit, receipt completion, and successor activation commit atomically. An independently purchased queued successor moves to the refund boundary with its full duration, and all later queued terms shift by the same delta.

## Member web workflow

`ConnectionsView.vue` remains a thin entrance over `components/connections`. The scan composable retains one start idempotency key after an ambiguous HTTP failure, polls only the accepted scan ID, and exposes progress, terminal failure, empty, and retry states. Completed IP rows use the server's signed handle; the browser never constructs or submits node identity alongside a drop. The confirmation overlay owns native Telegram Back and warns that provider-side selected-IP removal may interrupt other sessions behind the same public IP.

The active purchase card obtains server-owned reset and refund quotes. Paid reset and refund commands retain their idempotency keys until accepted, then poll the owner-scoped receipt. An eligible Refund action replaces automatic renewal; all other states keep the existing renewal control. `pending_review` and `partial` receipts block further member mutations and explicitly forbid retry while an administrator reconciles the provider outcome.

## Verification

CI owns migration, transaction-failure, idempotency-conflict, compensation, ambiguity, quiesce/restore, signed-handle, and queue-shifting tests. Local verification is limited to formatting, structure, lint, type/build, vet, and diff checks; provider and Telegram device behavior remains a deployed staging gate.

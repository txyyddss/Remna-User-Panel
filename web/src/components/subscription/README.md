# Subscription and uptime

`HomeUptimePanel.vue` replaces the home subscription block only for active combos.
Its subscription entrance stays centered on mobile and desktop; a failed read
places Retry on a separate row so it does not shift the entrance.
The entrance is a native button calling the named Vue Router route, following
the existing Connections action. It has no anchor URL for mobile Telegram to
open as a new Mini App document; in-memory routing preserves the launch context
and the shell retains native Back ownership.
`SubscriptionPage.vue` composes the full subscription URL, existing revoke and
connections actions, native host links, and squad history. `HostLinkRow.vue`
owns clipboard feedback and an on-demand QR popup using the installed `qrcode`
library and Nuxt UI modal. `SquadUptime.vue` keeps host history in native,
initially closed disclosures. `UptimeBar.vue` renders time-proportional intervals
with pointer and arrow-key inspection and localized, accessible status labels.

`useSubscriptionData.ts` owns live fetching, 60-second visible-page polling,
superseded request cancellation and lifecycle cleanup. It never restores or
persists bearer links. Successful revocation clears the previous snapshot before
loading current native links; unmounting drops all member data.

The typed client `web/src/api/subscription.ts` calls authenticated member routes.
The server authorizes active local ownership and preferences, joins upstream
host/inbound/node metadata, and derives histories from the existing monitor.
Unknown measurements are neutral gaps. Hosts are green/red; squads and the home
summary add yellow for partial outages, only with complete measurement coverage.
No probe credentials, latency, or numeric HTTP results enter these interfaces.

English and Chinese copy inherits the host-connectivity locale domain. Views
reuse the existing premium-dark layout and do not add dependencies.
`useSubscriptionData.test.ts` covers revocation clearing, obsolete response rejection, visible-page polling and disposal of private state in hosted CI. `UptimeBar.test.ts` covers keyboard inspection and neutral current status after refresh data expires.
`HomeUptimePanel.test.ts` covers entry navigation during loading, the absence of
a document link, and preservation of the Telegram launch URL in hosted CI.

# TX Carpool web client

TX Carpool is a bilingual, mobile-first Telegram Mini App built with Vue 3.5, Vite 8, and Nuxt UI v4. The flat graphite-and-mint interface supports phone and tablet layouts, Telegram theme/safe-area variables, keyboard navigation, reduced motion, and short English or Simplified Chinese copy.

## Commands

```sh
npm ci
npm run generate:api
npm run audit:structure
npm run check
npm run dev
```

`npm run check` enforces structure/localization policy, lints, type-checks, runs Vitest, and builds the production bundle. The build output goes to `../internal/webui/dist` for Go embedding.

## Application boundaries

- `src/App.vue` provides Nuxt UI's `UApp` context and locale binding.
- `src/main.ts` bootstraps compatibility before loading the app bundle, then either mounts a localized capability gate or initializes Telegram, Pinia, Vue Router, Nuxt UI, AutoAnimate, and global styles.
- `src/router/` lazy-loads member and administrator views and enforces onboarding/role access.
- `src/stores/` holds only session-wide authenticated identity state.
- `src/api/` contains generated OpenAPI types, focused contracts, and one same-origin transport. Authenticated calls use the companion request key to sign the exact method, path/query, timestamp, nonce, and body bytes, including a secure HMAC fallback when Web Crypto is unavailable.
- `src/i18n/` merges parity-checked locale shards from `locales/en/` and `locales/zh-CN/`; user-facing copy belongs there rather than in components or composables.
- `src/composables/` owns remote state, polling, cancellation, idempotency, and mutations.
- `src/components/` composes Nuxt UI controls into domain features; Iconify supplies all Phosphor and country icons, so no local icon assets are shipped. `vite.config.ts` keeps the Nuxt UI icon registry and dynamic feature registries in the client bundle explicitly; source scanning remains enabled for static icon references.
- `src/styles/` defines the flat premium-dark tokens, safe-area layout, restrained motion, and tablet breakpoints without gradients or decorative shadows.
- `scripts/` generates compact contract output and enforces repository structure in CI.

Each source folder has its own `README.md` file map. Start with [the source map](src/README.md), [component architecture](src/components/ARCHITECTURE.md), and [locale catalog](locales/README.md).

## Member features

- Resumable intro, immutable username, and agreement onboarding; decisive onboarding actions mirror to Telegram's native MainButton when available.
- Community group and channel access stays outside onboarding, shows canonical Telegram membership, and requires a currently active combo only when joining.
- Dashboard balance, entitlement, Remnawave traffic, node summaries, and subscription-link rotation.
- A six-step catalog journey for core combos, optional squads, accessible nodes, coupon redemption, review, and idempotent purchase confirmation.
- Provider/rail selection, exact payment instructions, QR/address rendering, cancellation, and authoritative settlement polling.
- Provider redirects land on `/payment-result`, which verifies durable payment state: paid orders show the green confirmation, while failed or expired orders offer an owner-verified replacement handoff to Home.
- Daily check-in, group-message progress, betting games, lucky draws, and bounded outcome history.
- Coupon wallet/redeem flow, active questionnaire participation, and durable validation codes.
- Emby account setup, retry, password change, parental rating, and library preferences.

## Administration

The live admin routes cover settings, catalog/squads, activity, coupons, questionnaires/CSV settlement, onboarding content, users, Emby accounts, entitlements, payments/refunds, backups/restore, the reviewed database editor, and audit history. Nuxt UI provides forms, selects, tables, modals, drawers, alerts, badges, and loading states; dynamic lists use AutoAnimate.

Financial and destructive operations retain text labels, busy states, explicit reasons, confirmations, and localized failures. The database editor never sends raw SQL: it uses typed filters, cursors, optimistic hashes, server diff review, rescue backup, and typed confirmation.

## Root files

- `.gitignore` excludes local frontend artifacts.
- `auto-imports.d.ts` records generated Nuxt UI composable declarations.
- `components.d.ts` records generated global component declarations.
- `eslint.config.js` defines Vue and TypeScript lint policy.
- `go.mod` keeps the frontend outside the root Go module walk.
- `index.html` is the dark, isolated SPA document.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` pin commands and dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json` defines strict TypeScript/Vue compilation.
- `vite.config.ts` configures Nuxt UI, locale parity, tests, proxying, and embedded output.

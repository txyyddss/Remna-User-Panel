# Hosted Go race checks

`race_shards.py` is called only by GitHub Actions. Eight independent runners split
the database package's top-level tests, executable examples and fuzz seed tests,
and partition every other Go package. New packages and checks are discovered
from Go itself; no handwritten allowlist can silently omit them.

`race_inventory.py` owns discovery and exact-once partition validation. Each
runner uploads its complete inventory, assigned checks, completion marker and
JSON diagnostics. The existing Go race and coverage gate validates all eight
manifests before running the unchanged domain coverage packages and 70% gate.

Per-runner Go parallelism follows available CPUs. Database tests retain their
existing two-open migration semaphore and isolated temporary databases. Shards
have independent processes and CPU allocations, so migration concurrency does
not multiply on one machine. Do not invoke these scripts locally: repository
instructions permit automated suites only in hosted CI.

`change_base.py` selects the latest successful `Container` run on `main` whose
commit is an ancestor of the checked-out tree. Push filters compare against that
published commit, so frontend-only changes skip Go checks after a successful
publication. Backend changes in canceled or failed runs remain in the next diff
and must pass before publication. The read-only GitHub Actions API uses the
workflow token; unavailable history or API errors run all gates. Release tags
also run all gates. Pull requests retain filtering against their base branch.
The workflow files and `scripts/ci` affect both quality gates; extend their path
filters when adding another shared CI input.
The aggregate gate follows the actual shard result, including failures, rather
than reevaluating changed-area output after the matrix has completed.

# Squad profiles

- `profile.go` defines the three local squad profile shapes and JSON fields.
- `normalize.go` validates, normalizes, and decodes persisted profile JSON.
- `countries.go` contains the ISO alpha-2 allowlist for country-only profiles.
- `profile_test.go` covers profile validation and persisted JSON normalization.

This package owns local squad metadata only. Remnawave remains authoritative for
squad identity, name, and availability. Profile values are normalized before
they reach SQLite and are never used to make upstream provider requests.

# Billing package
- `events_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.

Payment-method discovery, exact decimal arithmetic, checkout creation, provider event validation, and settlement live here.

## Files

- `service.go` defines settings/repository contracts, service construction, and checkout creation.
- `checkout.go` builds server-owned provider requests and validates checkout responses before persistence.
- `payment_operations.go` creates idempotent payment create/cancel commands with their order targets.
- `operation_worker.go` performs each provider mutation once after its durable attempt marker.
- `operation_worker_reconcile.go` resolves interrupted attempts from stored payment state or leaves them pending review.
- `payment_callback_operations.go` lets authoritative paid callbacks resolve matching checkout operations.
- `payment_announcement.go` delivers immutable successful-payment snapshots as escaped Telegram MarkdownV2 to the optional standalone channel through the durable outbox.
- `amount_bounds.go` loads the global inclusive Add TXB range and rejects checkout amounts outside it.
- `amount_bounds_test.go` covers configured inclusive payment boundaries.
- `payment_operations_test.go` covers atomic command queueing, idempotency conflicts, ambiguous outcomes, and callback resolution.
- `payment_announcement_test.go` covers MarkdownV2 provider/channel formatting, missing configuration, and retryable Telegram failures.
- `gateway_contracts.go` defines the server-owned provider checkout/event contracts and gateway interfaces.
- `payment_methods.go` builds the configured rail list, including coupon funding and independently selectable provider-account profiles.
- `events.go` validates and authorizes provider events, settles orders, exposes the narrow signed-return receipt projection, and handles cancellation.
- `payment_profile_runtime.go` gates channels from stable-ID profiles and derives each BEPusdt callback capability from the selected account credential.
- `methods.go` defines canonical payment method identifiers and enabled-rail ordering.
- `decimal.go` parses and computes exact TXB and provider-currency amounts without floating point.
- `service_test.go` covers checkout creation and provider failure paths.
- `events_test.go` covers event validation, authorization, settlement, and BEPUSDT compatibility.
- `service_test_helpers_test.go` contains shared billing repository, settings, and gateway doubles.
- `methods_test.go` covers documented method identifiers and rail ordering.
- `decimal_test.go` covers decimal parsing, equivalence, and rounding.
- `methods_service_test.go` covers configured method availability, cancellation behavior, and BEPusdt callback capabilities.
- `payment_profile_runtime_test.go` covers account-scoped BEPusdt callback capabilities.
- `zero_coverage_test.go` covers provider channel ordering, channel validation, and EZPay/BEPusdt method-list validation.
- `README.md` documents the package layout.

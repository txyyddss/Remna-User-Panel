This package owns the authoritative SQLite connection, migrations, transactional
repositories, durable outbox records, and restore validation. Domain services
depend on the `Store` methods; provider network calls do not belong here.

The persistence implementation is split by domain operation. The `_part2.go` files contain continuation methods for the corresponding bounded repository module.

- `activity_draws_part2.go`, `activity_extensions_part2.go`, and `activity_part2.go` continue activity persistence.
- `billing_payments_part2.go`, `coupons_part2.go`, and `coupons_part3.go` continue billing and coupon persistence.
- `emby_provisioning_part2.go`, `outbox_jobs_part2.go`, `questionnaires_part2.go`, `statistics_part2.go`, and `store_part2.go` continue their focused repositories.

`payment_profiles_test.go` covers independent provider-account persistence and stable-ID lookup.

The `migrations/` directory contains the ordered embedded schema history. New
schema changes must be additive migrations; deployed migration files are immutable.

Migration `015_payment_provider_profiles.sql` consolidates the temporary
per-rail profile table into one row per provider. Migration
`016_multiple_payment_profiles.sql` removes the provider-wide uniqueness
constraint so additional independent accounts can be stored. Legacy settings
remain available for decryption fallback, while new writes use the stable
profile record and preserve masked credentials.

`billing_courtesy_test.go` covers terminal-payment courtesy-credit atomicity,
idempotent replay, and late-provider-callback blocking.

`renewal_coupon.go` provides read-only recurring coupon reuse for retained legacy
batch pricing without coupon-use writes. `renewal_batch.go` projects retained
renewal batches and their purchase records. Automatic renewal uses its own
attached-coupon policy and a unique source-successor link.

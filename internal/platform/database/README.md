# SQLite store

`abuse_node_retention.go` reconciles key records against a successful complete
upstream list without deleting historical incidents. `abuse_node_retention_test.go`
covers deleted-key rejection and preserving credentials during provider outages.

`member_squad_preferences.go` stores disabled references and validates the last
enabled squad atomically. `member_combo_control_helpers.go` checks ownership,
queued order, pending mutations and bans. `member_early_activation.go` forfeits
and rebases terms without financial credits. `member_squad_controls_test.go`
and `member_early_activation_test.go` cover races, carried preferences, ownership,
custom durations, automatic successors and durable reset-phase resumption in CI.

`member_combo_recovery.go` revalidates live, owned, unsuperseded targets before
reopening a failed control receipt. Administrative job retry and failed-artifact
retention resume the same reset phase without repeating forfeiture or money
movement. `member_combo_recovery_test.go` covers exhausted upstream attempts,
both recovery paths, full term dates and unchanged balances in hosted CI.

The store uses `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.60.1 and its compatible libc dependency.
Go module upgrades preserve the existing Go 1.26 toolchain and database contracts;
full migration/race validation runs in hosted CI rather than local test suites.

Lucky-draw storage keeps configuration, ticket charges, reservations, and immutable outcomes local. Every Remnawave effect is enqueued after the result transaction; Telegram delivery uses recorded message IDs.

Private draw coupons (`admin_visible=0`) can only be used through awarded wallet grants. Code lookup excludes them, and the shared grant lookup and wallet listing reject historical `source_type='code'` copies. Checkout and automatic renewal therefore cannot use copied grants; existing financial records remain intact. `activity_draw_coupon_security_test.go` covers these boundaries and normal public-code redemption.

- `activity_draws.go` saves and audits mode-specific configuration; `activity_draws_part2.go` settles instant results atomically, binds replays to the same member and draw, and reserves `raffle:` keys for internal settlements.
- `activity_draw_replay_security_test.go` covers cross-draw conflicts, member isolation, reserved keys, and unchanged balances/randomness on replay.
- `activity_draw_list.go` lists member-safe instant draws and admin definitions; `activity_draw_reservations.go` reconciles active raffle loss holds when reward ranges change.
- `activity_reward_apply.go` applies resolved balance, coupon, purchase, traffic, and squad effects and queues provider synchronization.
- `activity_reward_combo.go` applies core-change prizes while retaining existing custom squads, renewal price, current/renewal traffic and rollover terms, including a zero-price custom renewal. Ordinary core changes adopt the target defaults. Pending rollover metadata is refreshed in the same transaction; provider synchronization stays in the existing outbox path.
- `activity_reward_combo_test.go` covers reward ordering and traffic lifetimes. `activity_reward_combo_migration_test.go` covers restoration, ambiguity exclusions, audit/sync deduplication and unchanged member balances/renewal switches. `CUSTOM_COMBO_RECOVERY.md` documents the repair boundaries and deployment checks.
- `activity_reward_combo_order_test.go` verifies that recovery leaves later custom awards untouched, including same-time settlements, zero-price awards and multiple custom prizes. An older core change cannot justify recovering a newer custom award whose overrides are missing.
- `activity_reward_ordered_recovery_test.go` and `activity_reward_recovery_fixture_test.go` exercise migration 055 with real raffle settlement/ticket ordering and reconstructed legacy states, including multiple custom prizes, temporary/recurring traffic, missing links, pending rollovers and preservation of newer awards.
- `activity_reward_cadence_test.go` and `activity_reward_cadence_migration_test.go` cover cadence snapshots, legacy inheritance, ordinary core defaults, later custom awards and migration 056 recovery across automatic-renewal ancestry. Custom cadence uses the existing purchase override and is synchronized through the normal outbox.
- `activity_reward_traffic.go` tracks current-term and renewal traffic separately so recurring rewards cannot preserve temporary gains or losses. Eligibility and settlement reject deductions that would exhaust either allowance. `activity_reward_traffic_test.go` covers mixed reward ordering and renewal coverage.
- `activity_raffle_entries.go` sells deduplicated seats; `activity_raffle_settle.go` refunds expired eligibility or assigns fixed stock atomically and accepts retries after a refund reopened the raffle.
- `activity_raffle_settle_retry_test.go` covers a recovered settlement job arriving after the raffle has reopened.
- `activity_draw_payload_migration_test.go` covers recovery of numeric-revision decode failures while preserving the unique active-job constraint and unrelated errors.
- `activity_raffle_publish.go` keeps drafts closed until the group announcement message ID is recorded, reserves triggers through settlement, and queues late-message cleanup after cancellation. Publishing terms are frozen until confirmation so the charged price matches the announcement.
- `activity_raffle_lifecycle_test.go` covers publishing edits, late cancellation cleanup, stale settlement jobs, and trigger collisions during settlement.
- `activity_raffle_accounting_test.go` covers concurrent message replay, reserved balances, rollback on randomness failure, exact stock distribution, ledger reconciliation, and settlement replay.
- `activity_raffle_tickets.go` holds ticket scans and exact fee-plus-reservation refunds shared by cancellation and settlement.
- `activity_raffle_eligibility.go` checks cumulative negative-traffic exposure against the smallest entitlement available after configured combo rewards.
- `activity_raffle_queries.go` supplies routing, progress, outcome, and delivery lookups; `activity_forecast.go` prices draws from current catalog and eligible balances.
- `activity_forecast_prices.go` derives reward expense bounds from current combo and squad prices plus eligible member balances.
- `catalog_geocheck.go` reads the per-squad Geocheck display setting, defaulting to enabled without creating rows. `catalog_geocheck_test.go` covers default-on, omission-preserving writes, and sparse override cleanup when re-enabled.
- `activation_codes.go` validates selected combo/add-on activation-code maps in the purchase transaction while keeping only bcrypt hashes in local overrides.
- `activation_codes_test.go` covers missing, invalid, extra, and bcrypt-validated purchase codes.
- `activity_draws_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `activity_extensions_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `activity_history_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `activity_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `billing_payments_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `coupon_purchase_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `coupons_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `coupons_part3.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `emby_provisioning_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `outbox_jobs_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `questionnaire_queries_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `questionnaires_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `rollover_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `statistics_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.
- `store_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.

This package owns the authoritative SQLite connection, migrations, transactional
repositories, durable outbox records, and restore validation. Domain services
depend on the `Store` methods; provider network calls do not belong here.

The persistence implementation is split by domain operation. The `_part2.go` files contain continuation methods for the corresponding bounded repository module.

- `activity_draws_part2.go`, `activity_extensions_part2.go`, and `activity_part2.go` continue activity persistence.
- `billing_payments_part2.go`, `coupons_part2.go`, and `coupons_part3.go` continue billing and coupon persistence.
- `emby_provisioning_part2.go`, `outbox_jobs_part2.go`, `questionnaires_part2.go`, `statistics_part2.go`, and `store_part2.go` continue their focused repositories.

`payment_profiles_test.go` covers independent provider-account persistence and stable-ID lookup.

The `migrations/` directory contains the ordered embedded schema history. New
schema changes must be additive migrations; deployed migration files are immutable.

Migration `015_payment_provider_profiles.sql` consolidates the temporary
per-rail profile table into one row per provider. Migration
`016_multiple_payment_profiles.sql` removes the provider-wide uniqueness
constraint so additional independent accounts can be stored. Legacy settings

`renewal_coupon.go` provides read-only recurring coupon reuse for retained legacy
batch pricing without coupon-use writes. `renewal_batch.go` projects retained
renewal batches and their purchase records. Automatic renewal uses its own
attached-coupon policy and a unique source-successor link.

`user_preferences.go` merges nine persisted preference flags atomically, projects active-combo eligibility and resolves legacy referral delivery recipients.
`user_preferences_test.go` covers defaults, partial merges, account isolation, eligibility loss and referral attribution.

`telegram_boost_receipts.go` and `telegram_boost_receipts_test.go` atomically deduplicate group/boost IDs with their outbox work, including concurrent and changed updates. No boost count is mirrored.

`panel_entry_verification.go` and `panel_entry_verification_test.go` persist only Telegram ID and a boolean. Panel visits initialize the row, verification or a disabled challenge qualifies it, and onboarding removes it in the same transaction as agreement acceptance.
Retained agreement revisions also qualify returning accounts. `remna_provisioning.go` preserves a completed account's verification before username-conflict recovery clears agreement fields; `remna_provisioning_test.go` checks that recovery does not request another challenge.

`telegram_pm_commands.go` deduplicates webhook IDs and atomically queues notices or reference-only relay operations. `telegram_pm_reads.go` infers read timestamps from member replies and stores references against delivery IDs only. `telegram_pm_queries.go` joins routing and normalized user flags; `telegram_pm_pages.go` reuses stable cursors and exposes bounded delivery references with read evidence. `telegram_pm_moderation.go` audits idempotent flags/repair commands and queues profile refreshes; `telegram_pm_topics.go` claims creation and records durable topic/profile certainty. `telegram_pm_recovery.go` resumes only definitely unsent waiters after a proven repair. `telegram_pm_retention.go` bounds receipts at 30 days while preserving routing uncertainty; generic maintenance protects recent PM operations and conversation owners.
`telegram_pm_commands_test.go`, `telegram_pm_permissions_test.go`, `telegram_pm_topics_test.go` and `telegram_pm_retention_test.go` cover concurrent replay, normalized flags across destinations, unauthorized mutation, serialized topic/card phases, safe recovery, retention boundaries and foreign keys in hosted CI.
`telegram_pm_reads_test.go` covers reply-inferred read state. `admin_balance_reference_test.go` covers stable-reference replay without duplicate ledger or audit effects.

`retention_node_events.go` expires every node-down event status seven days after creation, detaches node-state references and cascades frozen details. Already approved purchase extensions and queued `node_compensation` operation targets remain independently executable; a continuing outage starts a fresh window on the next complete provider sample. `retention_sync_jobs.go` removes terminal failed outbound synchronization/delivery jobs after three days from final failure (`updated_at`), while preserving active work and explicit queued retries. It reconciles linked purchase, provisioning, scan and PM certainty state without financial writes. Local rollover, raffle and questionnaire settlement lanes retain their existing recovery paths. `retention_timestamps.go` uses indexed candidates and parsed instants for exact fractional-second boundaries. Counts flow through the existing backup-gated maintenance report. `retention_node_events_test.go` and `retention_sync_jobs_test.go` cover creation/failure boundaries, all event statuses, fresh outages, approved extensions, independent sync, financial ownership, PM uncertainty, explicit retries and foreign keys in hosted CI.

`connectivity_attempts.go`, `connectivity_queries.go`, `connectivity_scan.go` and `connectivity_retention.go` implement the `connectivity.Repository` interface against one indexed diagnostic-attempt table. A probe inserts its identity and running state before execution, then seals a sanitized terminal result with a conditional transition. Host UUID is nullable for setup failures; resolved proxy configurations, host metadata and credentials are never persisted. Latest results are derived by host and configuration hash, while history uses the shared filter-bound timestamp cursor with a default page of 50 and a maximum of 200. Fixed-width UTC nanosecond timestamps provide exact indexed ordering and retention comparisons. Every read excludes attempts at or before `now-24h`, independently of pruning. Checker startup interrupts unfinished attempts without changing their start, and its independent five-minute cleanup calls the pruning method even while scheduling is disabled. Mutations use the existing store write lock and context-aware SQLite calls; the storage module performs no external API calls. The connectivity lifecycle, queries, retention and concurrency tests cover terminal immutability, nullable setup results, sanitized codes, restart recovery, pagination, configuration separation and exact fractional-second expiry in hosted CI.

`connectivity_lifecycle_test.go`, `connectivity_queries_test.go`, `connectivity_retention_test.go` and `connectivity_concurrency_test.go` exercise those repository invariants in hosted CI; `connectivity_test_helpers_test.go` provides credential-free attempt fixtures.

`connectivity_timeline.go` reads all retained terminal host observations for exactly one configuration hash and the rolling 24-hour cutoff. The existing indexed attempt table provides history; setup failures and running checks cannot fabricate downtime, and pagination cannot truncate the derived timeline.
`connectivity_timeline_test.go` covers configuration isolation, exact retention and complete observation retrieval beyond administrative page limits in hosted CI.
- `ip_lookup_settings.go` atomically saves encrypted settings, combo quotas and the admin audit.
- `ip_lookup_queries.go` reads fresh quota/pricing quotes and owner-scoped immutable report receipts.
- `ip_lookup_commands.go` atomically debits quota/TXB and coalesces checks into shared cached or fresh reports.
- `ip_lookup_completion.go` persists attempt progress and completes or refunds joined requests exactly once.
- `ip_lookup_test.go` covers cache sharing, prices, replays, refunds and purchase quota lifecycle for CI.
- `ip_lookup_migration_test.go` covers the one-check gift for live members, excluding queued and expired purchases.

- `ip_lookup_refunds.go` centralizes exactly-once cost restoration and closes interrupted shared runs during existing operation maintenance.
- `ip_lookup_policy_test.go` covers free cached checks, refunds for any outage, and durable receipts across maintenance.

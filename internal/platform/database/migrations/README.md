# Database migrations

`059_member_squad_preferences.sql` stores only disabled squad references per
account; purchase ownership and upstream names are not duplicated.

Migration files are embedded and applied in lexical order by `database.go`.

- `056_restore_custom_combo_reset_cadence.sql` fills missing custom reset-strategy overrides from the latest matching award's original core combo, including live automatic-renewal successors. Explicit cadence overrides and audited entitlement edits remain untouched; repairs are audited and synchronized through the existing outbox.

- `055_restore_ordered_custom_combo_rewards.sql` follows up 054 using settled raffle ticket order to distinguish same-time prizes and reconstruct recorded temporary/recurring traffic. It verifies surviving fields against the old core-reset behavior and preserves later custom awards, administrator changes and financial records.

- `054_restore_custom_combo_after_core_reward.sql` restores erased custom terms on current purchases when immutable reward history proves a custom award followed by a core-change prize. It skips ambiguous or subsequently edited histories, records an audit event and queues provider sync without changing balances or renewal enablement. See [recovery boundaries](../CUSTOM_COMBO_RECOVERY.md).

- `030_affiliates.sql` adds referral eligibility, immutable tier versions, settlements, and awards.
- `031_user_notifications.sql` adds durable semantic notification deduplication
  and provider-success release gates.
- `032_automatic_traffic_reset.sql` adds the account-wide opt-in preference
  used by the five-minute traffic scanner.
- `033_node_compensation.sql` adds nullable revisioned policy, persistent node state, immutable outage snapshots, frozen recipients, and reviewed operation linkage.
Never edit a migration that may already have been deployed; add the next numbered
file instead.

  values while retaining the nullable column for backup/restore schema compatibility.
- `011_minimize_payment_payloads.sql` — clears terminal provider display payloads
  that are not required for settlement.
- `012_minimize_questionnaire_imports.sql` — removes settled CSV payloads and
  aligns exhausted questionnaire jobs with the retry lifecycle.

  rollover aggregates, and the temporary per-rail payment profile seed.
- `015_payment_provider_profiles.sql` consolidates each provider into one
  profile row with independently enabled channels and removes the temporary
  per-rail table.
- `016_multiple_payment_profiles.sql` allows multiple independent EZPay and
  BEPusdt accounts while preserving the existing provider profile rows.
- `017_squad_profiles.sql` adds nullable normalized local metadata for the
  three customer-facing internal-squad profile types without duplicating the
  generated description.
- `018_automatic_renewal.sql` adds opt-in automatic-renewal state, a durable
  due-cycle failure notice, recurring-discount attachment, and a unique
  source-successor link while leaving legacy renewal records intact.
- `019_rollover_activation_codes.sql` removes the persisted rollover cap and
  adds bcrypt-backed squad activation metadata.
- `020_release1_commerce.sql` converts monthly cadence to `MONTH_ROLLING`, snapshots immutable core price, and adds billing limits, provider receipts, connection scans, upload metadata, and replay facts.
- `021_admin_workflows.sql` adds purchase-level entitlement overrides and the durable backup-upload publication saga.
- `022_release1_rollups.sql` adds cleanup leases, compact activity/payment/purchase rollups, and timestamped statistics partitions.
- `023_payment_callback_tombstones.sql` keeps compact provider-callback replay
  evidence after terminal payment detail is pruned.
- `024_operation_durability.sql` allows review-required connection scans and
  preserves actor-scoped staged-restore replay identity across a database swap.
- `025_mutation_durability.sql` adds review-required Emby state and prevents concurrent open setup commands.
- `026_group_message_facts.sql` stores deduplicated raw configured-group non-command message facts for cumulative statistics.
- `027_host_operation_guard.sql` prevents a new host remark mutation while the same host still has an unresolved operation.
- `028_connection_ip_blocks.sql` stores only active encrypted node-scoped IP
  blocks and their scheduled three-day cleanup references.
- `029_security_and_history_indexes.sql` bounds each user to one current session
  and indexes stable administrative inventories plus questionnaire history.
- `034_abuse_qps_detector.sql` adds encrypted node credentials, privacy-safe QPS samples, detector state, incidents, delivery records, and temporary-ban restoration facts.
- `035_abuse_warning_cooldown.sql` adds the revisioned administrator warning-record cooldown.
- `036_purchase_addon_adjustments.sql` records idempotent, prorated active-term squad additions without duplicating user or provider data.
- `037_abuse_pending_qps_index.sql` indexes detector-state continuation scans so completed sample windows are not repeatedly evaluated.
- `038_durable_abuse_processing.sql` adds configurable streak duration, durable
  normalized event claims, 30-minute QPS rollups, replay-safe incident facts,
  and completion evidence for safely pruning detailed abuse records.
- `039_abuse_record_retention_and_ip_bans.sql` preserves detector records for
  the configured retention period, removes irrelevant punishment durations,
  and persists asynchronous IP-ban scans across retries.
- `040_admin_user_provider_commands.sql` adds durable administrator temporary-ban state and scheduled restoration linkage.
- `041_admin_coupon_discard_commands.sql` records administrator coupon-discard idempotency without deleting historical grants.

- `048_rollover_calculated_settlement.sql` adds the calculated rollover state so traffic can be measured before an atomic automatic-renewal settlement.
- `049_retry_rejected_telegram_markup.sql` requeues only failed Telegram jobs whose
  stored error proves a Markdown entity rejection; ambiguous sends stay failed.
- `050_restore_missing_remna_signup.sql` returns members stranded by the former
  missing-user agreement flow to completed local onboarding; startup queues paid
  unlinked accounts for reconciliation.
- `052_retry_safe_telegram_draw_jobs.sql` requeues transactional raffle settlement, definitively rejected Telegram parse jobs, and safe raffle edit errors after the recovery fixes; ambiguous sends remain failed.
- `053_retry_draw_payload_decode.sql` resets failed or delayed raffle-update and settlement jobs rejected by the former string-only payload decoder. It requires the matching decode error, a string draw ID, and an integer revision, and keeps at most one active job per payload. Duplicate failed rows, other failures, and processing jobs retain their state.

- `058_require_boosted_group_messages.sql` resets unfinished message progress and its counted flags once; paid rewards and retained message identities are preserved. Version 057 is reserved for the concurrent preferences change.

`057_user_preferences.sql` adds per-user choices and clears optional entrances on purchase eligibility transitions and later purchases.

`060_telegram_boost_receipts.sql` keeps only group/boost identity and receipt time to prevent repeat appreciation.

`061_panel_entry_verification.sql` creates the two-column temporary verification table; previously accepted agreements need no migrated row.

`062_telegram_pm.sql` adds two normalized user moderation flags, per-user/per-destination routing references, durable certainty and bounded update tombstones. A partial unique index serializes profile publication and repair without duplicating message bodies.

`063_retention_scan_indexes.sql` indexes event creation and final failed-job timestamps for bounded maintenance scans without additional retained data.

`064_telegram_pm_read_status.sql` adds reference-only explicit and reply-inferred read evidence for successful PM deliveries; deleting a delivery cascades its read state.

`065_host_connectivity_attempts.sql` adds one indexed, credential-free connectivity attempt table. Starts define a rolling 24-hour diagnostic window; latest results are derived without a second table or mirrored host data. A nullable host reference records setup failures, and terminal transitions retain the original start timestamp.

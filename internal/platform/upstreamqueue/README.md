# Upstream queue
- `queue_part2.go` continues the focused implementation from its original package module.

This package owns the in-memory admission queues for synchronous provider API
calls. Each provider gets a separate bounded FIFO and one context-owned worker,
so slow Remnawave traffic cannot block Emby traffic (or vice versa).

`Do` and `Execute` wait for capacity, provider pacing, and the final result. The
caller's context cancels all three phases. Application shutdown also cancels the
active call and stops accepting new work without closing a channel that may
still have concurrent senders.

This queue is intentionally not durable. Database outbox jobs remain the source
of truth for retryable mutations; an outbox handler enters this queue immediately
before invoking its provider adapter.

- `queue.go` owns bounded FIFO admission, provider pacing, lifecycle transitions, shutdown, and cancellation merging.
- `result.go` exposes typed `Do` and error-only `Execute` helpers with panic containment and caller cancellation.
- `queue_test.go` verifies validation, results, panic recovery, backpressure, pacing, active-call cancellation, and shutdown state.
- `queue_part2.go` contains queue worker and lifecycle helpers.
